Chances are if you’ve made it to this article and this site, you’re familiar in some way with derivatives and their place in centralized financial markets, if not in defi’s. If you aren’t familiar with derivatives, then the first half of this article will provide you with the base knowledge to proceed.  

Derivatives have proven to be more than a useful financial tool for many, with the main utility of supporting long-term growth for any class of assets. Some of the most common underlying securities for derivatives are stocks and bonds. They are made up of contracts and have a price and future settlement date.  

Because of the future aspect of these contracts, derivatives are now most commonly used as hedging tools to offset risk when investing in assets, securities, or portfolios. However, they have come a long way since their conception.  

When derivatives were first introduced, they completely revolutionized the agricultural industry. With the financial success of one’s farm  dependent on a verbal agreement or handshake, unpredictable conditions like weather or the economy could bankrupt a farm in just a few unlucky seasonal cycles with no binding legal recourse. Derivatives instantly became an attractive method of hedging seasonal risk by securing future sales of crops and livestock.  

It wasn't long before the financial sectors took notice of the potential value created by derivatives. Legal contracts that secured future commerce could be invaluable, especially in markets that were particularly turbulent such as the stock market. From farm to market, derivatives invaded the world of centralized finance. Options contracts, a form of derivatives, cementing derivatives as the go-to tool for mitigation of risk in financial ventures.  

So how exactly do options work and what is the utility behind them? 

Basically, options are derivative contracts without an obligation for fulfillment. When the option expires, the owner of an option can “exercise” the right to buy or sell an asset (or security) for an agreed upon price, called the strike price. Equity options, perhaps the most popular form of option in the centralized market, give the contract owner the right to buy or sell stock. A call option allows the owner to purchase while a put option allows the owner to sell at for the strike price.  

Derivatives have been a massive hit in the world of centralized finance ever since the 1970's. The total market size of all derivatives  is estimated at close to an unfathomable 1 quadrillion USD, casting an overwhelming shadow over all other markets including stocks, bonds, and the infant cryptocurrency market (which just passed 1 trillion USD).

Due to the fact that every growing market has a symbiotic derivatives market that has been historically shown to become even bigger than its market partner, many speculate that derivatives in defi have the potential to become absolutely massive.
in contrast to traditional finance, can be created by anyone in a completely permissionless and open way. This in turn increases the rate of innovation that has been stagnating in traditional finance already for a while. 


One advantage the derivatives have in defi are smart contracts. Since all transactions including the purchase of tokenized options, are verified on the blockchain, tokenized derivatives can be drafted without a third party allowing them to be created by anyone and in a completely permissionless and trust-less way. 

This advantage over its cousins in centralized finance has led many to muse over just how large the potential is for derivatives to become in defi. The number of platforms for purchasing tokenized options has grown rapidly over the last 3 years to over 100 million dollars in total value locked and this number is still growing daily.  

DefiNet aims to help this fledgling market grow by aggregating the growing number of new options platforms and helping them to compete in the innovative new ways that defi does best.
