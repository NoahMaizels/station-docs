##  Introduction

DefiNet is a financial protocol focused on the aggregation of decentralized derivatives on the Ethereum Network and improving access to all on-chain financial instruments. The recent explosion of interest in the major platforms offering these derivatives, mainly call/put options, has exposed multiple 'pain points' felt by users and sellers alike. Most of these issues are the result of a fragmented marketplace, created by the natural partition between platforms seen in many blockchain technologies. This has led to an absence of competition in price, quality, and innovation on a scale likely to impair growth for the industry as a whole. The learning curve for new blockchain users to interact with on-chain applications is causing a stagnate marketplace, where users opt for convenience and familiarity, over the hassle of comparing prices and features from different providers. The solution to this problem is clear, take the users across each individual platform, and put them together in one place to give them access to all derivative products available. To accomplish this, DefiNet will provide a system for comparing derivatives from multiple providers that is fast, simple, and trustless, enabling ***the invisible hand of the market*** to create efficiency in a sector that demands it to achieve long term stability and success.




## Platform Overview


"*Defi Derivatives Aggregator*" as a description of the DefiNet platform has the potential to include a wide array of different products, and the long term vision we have for our platform is to do just that. However, we have seen countless project overextend early and collapse as a result, keeping a new project simple and focused at launch is vital to support long term stablity. This influenced our decision to focus on 3 key products at launch refered to as the '*Core Protocols*':

1. Decentralized Put/Call Option Aggregator (DOA)
2. Smart Order Routing (SOR)
3. Cross-Asset Payment Pool (CAPP)   

These products will serve as the foundation for devloping the innovations neccessary to accomodate a rapidly expanding industry for years to come. The documentation from this point forward will focus on an in depth technical analysis of the DefiNet *Core Protocols*, and our vision for the future of decentralized derivatives.




## Decentralized Option Aggregator(DOA)




### Overview

The Decentralized Option Aggregator(DOA) is the main service available on the DefiNet platform, it allows users to compare prices and other features between different on-chain option providers. The DOA has been designed with a focus on simplicity, speed, and convenience, for our users. Using the DOA is similar to using any defi aggregator, users can specify the desired properties of the options they wish to compare(Asset, Put/Call, Strike, Expiry, and other features). After this, the user submits a request, and 10 closely matching options are returned from multiple defi platforms for comparison. Lastly, the user is then free to purchase the option(s) that best fit their needs.

## Smart Order Routing(SOR) 


### Overview<
Smart Order Routing(SOR) is the automated process of order handling, and has become a powerful tool for efficient token swaps in the defi space. Joshua Darby wrote a great article that breaks down SOR here -> (insert link). If you are not familiar with SOR I highly recommend you read that article before moving forward in this section. SOR has cemented itself as the standard in price efficient token swaps, the DefiNet platform introduces a new use case for SOR by applying it to non token based assets for the first time. This innovation of SOR does more than just create efficiency, it solves a real and significant issue that has plagued options platforms for years, Most platforms that sell derivatives do not have collateral available in the amounts neccessary to fill large institutional orders. DefiNet will solve this problem by utilizing SOR to fill large orders across multiple platforms and spreading the collateral between each one. This service will allow large financial institutions to inject capital into the decentralized derivatives marketplace at much higher levels than are being seen today.
