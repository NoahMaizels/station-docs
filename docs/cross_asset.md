Since their inception, AMMs have held a strong influence over DeFi and it's not hard to see why. They have facilitated the movement of billions of dollars, jumpstarted funding for new protocols and provided a medium for millions of buyers and sellers to exchange DeFi currencies. Automated market makers, sometimes referred to as liquidity pools, also create opportunities for investors and arbitrageurs to turn a profit. With how much decentralized finance markets have come to rely on AMMs, its difficult to imagine life without them. 

Perhaps one of the biggest reasons that AMMs took off as fast as they did is they embody the ideals of blockchain technology. No single institution controlls them and anyone can participate or build new solutions. 

Before AMMs, decentralized exchanges (DEXs) experienced sluggish growth. At the time there were far less users and holders of defi assets. As a result of limited access to liquidity, buyers and sellers had a difficult time trading freely. It was then that defi protocol *Uniswap* invented the automated market maker.    

Unlike anything that came before it, AMMs worked by pooling assets together. Early pools were simple, two-asset exchange pools, and are still the most popular type of liquidity pool in defi today. Users  trade their asset to the pool and get an equal value of the other. At the time, this was revolutionary. AMMs also incentivize investors to become liquidity providers by lending their assets to the pool. In exchange for this service, liquidity providers are rewarded in the form of fees aquired through trading. Similar to dividends paid to stock holders, trade fees are dispensed to asset providers according to extent of their contribution.    

Amms made it possible for defi tokens to be crowdfunded by the community and put to use for the benefit of the community. DEXs that made use of AMMs exploded with exponential growth as users and LPs flocked to join the market. *Uniswap*'s market value climbed ever higher and in the third quarter of 2020, they overtook the CEX (centralized exchange), *Coinbase*, by almost $2 billion. With over 90% of DEXs adopting AMMs, liquidity pools had become the standard for how business was conducted in DeFi.  

It's safe to say that AMMs revolutionized the DeFi market. However, they are not without flaw. <Read more on impermanent loss here*insert link to article on impermanent loss*>  

There are 3 main factors responsible for ongoing criticisms of AMMs.  

1. Issues with slippage due to inefficient asset utilization 
2. Unwanted risk exposure for LPs (liquidity providers)  
3. Impermanent loss

Uniswap allocates their funds equally across the entire price range so only a small percentage of assets are allocated close enough to the market value to be used effectively. The rest of the assets do nothing, leading to slippage.  

Because Uniswap pools require that there be an equal value of each asset. Therefore LPs that want to deposit funds into a 50/50 pool for example must provide an equivalent amount of the 2nd token as well. Twice the asset, twice the risk.  

<*Here is our article on impermanent loss* > Impermanent loss more than just a minor annoyance to many LPs. The prospects of actually losing money from investment is enough to deter many potential liquidity providers.  

 

DefiNet’s new cross asset pool takes care of all three of these pain points. DefiNet uses oracles to determine price so while slippage may still occur, and it is definitely something that will be looked into, it is safe to say it will not be due to an inefficient allocation of assets.  

Liquidity providers can also rest assured that they will not be required to deposit more than one asset at a time. The ratios between assets in DefiNet’s pool are not codependent for pricing, due to the above mentioned on-chain oracle pricing. The ratios between assets in a cross asset pool are constantly in motion with every option bought through its exchange.  

Impermanent loss is also no concern for LPs to the cross-asset pool. Arbitrageurs will be motivated not by making a quick turnaround because our prices will remain constant with market value. Instead, the balance of asset ratios will be maintained by LPs due to a scaling reward structure. The more deficient an in-demand asset is, the higher the reward for providing it to the pool.  

In summary: 

Automatic market makers (AMMs) revolutionized how everything was done on defi. They are almost solely responsible for the explosive growth of not only DEX platforms, but all platforms across the market. Uniswap introduced us to the first AMM and it quickly became the standard adopted by an overwhelming majority of new and established crypto platforms. Liquidity providers had incentives to lend out their assets, and traders finally had a more than enough liquidity available to exchange with and for. Uniswaps liquidity pool model isn’t without flaws. Due to codependency between assets, liquidity providers have twice the risk than if they were able to lend a single type of token. Slippage and impermanent loss further hurt LPs and can deter them from investment.  
Definet offers a solution via its cross-asset pool. On chain oracles pricing takes care of many of the concerns with the standard AMM model. Highest and most dependable ROI makes the cross-asset pool one of the most profitable pools to invest in defi.
